# Overview

- There are a few implemented sorting algorithms, such as:
  - bjornsson sort
  - insertion sort
  - selection sort
- Those files lie in the `algos` directory. The files contain implementations which are meant for different purposes. If the filename contains:
  - `comp`, that is meant to count the number of comparisons the algorithm makes. If you want to see the simplest version of the algorithm look at this.
  - `cpu`, that is meant to be a fast version of the algorithm which is used to measure performance. If you want to see how each algorithm can be optimized look at this.
- In the `utils` directory are some helpful utility functions such as reading input and validating that the arrays are sorted
- The rest of the directories contain simple files for taking inputs and running the algorithms for various types of input data
