# Overview

- There are a few implemented sorting algorithms, such as:
  - bjornsson sort
  - insertion sort
  - selection sort
- Those files lie in the 'algos' directory. The files have different suffixes:
  - \_comp: Outputs the average number of comparisons over all test cases
  - \_cpu: Outputs the average cpu time used over all test cases
- In the 'utils' directory are some helpful utility functions such as reading input and validating that the arrays are sorted
